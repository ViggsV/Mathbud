#  Robot Calculator (with Attitude)

A **simple calculator helper bot** powered by math.js, Tailwind CSS, and the legendary **SAM** speech synth from 1982.

This calculator doesn’t just help you crunch numbers — it **talks back**. Make a mistake, and the robot will let you know just how disappointed it is in your math skills.

##  Features

-  Clean calculator UI 
-  Math parsing with **[math.js](https://mathjs.org/)**
-  Retro robotic speech using **[SAM.js](https://github.com/discordier/sam)** (Software Automatic Mouth)
-  Speaks every button press and reads your final result
-  Throws out snarky error messages when you fail basic arithmetic

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript**  
- **[math.js](https://mathjs.org/)** – for expression evaluation  
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – utility-first styling  
- **[SAM.js](https://github.com/discordier/sam)** – a JavaScript port of the 1982 Commodore 64 speech synth

##  How It Works

- Press buttons → robot says them out loud  
- Hit `=` → it speaks the result  
- Mess up → expect robotic disappointment
