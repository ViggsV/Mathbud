# ðŸ¤– Robot Calculator (with Attitude)

A **simple calculator helper bot** powered by math.js, Tailwind CSS, and the legendary **SAM** speech synth from 1982.

This calculator doesnâ€™t just help you crunch numbers â€” it **talks back**. Make a mistake, and the robot will let you know just how disappointed it is in your math skills.

##  Setup

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.

Make sure `samjs.js` is included â€” it's the standalone version of SAM used for GitHub Pages compatibility.

You donâ€™t need npm or a build step â€” itâ€™s all pure frontend.
